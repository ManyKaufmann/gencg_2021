### Patterns

Sketched a pattern which is made with circles.

Notes: Could extend that in different colors and play with sizes.

Wasn't very inspired to work on this further so decided to play around with other stuff.

### more Stuff

Inspired by Victor Vasarely

My version is more minimialistic. I only defiend three colors, just because I don't want to have it that colorful and I only work with rect as outline and with ellipse inline.
