# Day 07 + 08

## || 13.10.21 + 15.10.21

## PROJECT

The last two days we could focus on working further on our latest work from the other days, finish the journal or create something new.

After I tried out the mic input, I really wanted to try out to do something with sound and generate something out of this. So I tried out to use fft.

From the waveform you get the input for the waves. At the beginning it was just a waveline. After some research and inspiration I chose to put this line as a circle and combine it with particles which.

For the particles I made a seperate class. Depends de amp the particle will move.

Where I spent to much time and I almost lost my patient, was to chose a song. Depends de amplitude it was very difficult to smooth it out that the particle get faster when they should. And after everytime I changed the song I had to adjust all parameters again which influenced the wave and the particle. It was not easy for me, who was working the first time whith that to find the perfect timing.

Playing with the vizualisation was very fun as well. Only changing the colors or some other parameters you could create very cool stuff or it was just ugly. Most of the time when I ramdomly adjust the parameters I found very cool new stuff.

The hardest part about this project was to get the feeling for the sound and to put it on the screen that people who watch this has an amazing expirience. But my problem was, that you can lose yourself very fast in just adjusting some parameters or searching for the perfect song to make it perfect. But the good thing about is. If you dive more and more into this, you have so many different new ideas and I am excited to go further in this topic to experiment more and create new things.

Next step I would like to try out to use the my work with the camera inputs and pixels with fft. For example to change colors depends de amp or let the shapes getting bigger.
