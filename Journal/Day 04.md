## DRAWING MACHINE

### Hot Wire

GOAL: Create TOGETHER-its BETTER.

OPTION ONE:
Create together something.

OPTION TWO:
PlayerOne(Keyboard): Controll the lines with the arrow keyboard.
PlayerTwo(Mouse): Follow PlayerOne's line with the mouse as good as possible.
Extended: PlayerTwo with mouse goes first and PlayerOne follows.

Idea: My idea was to create a drawing machine which two person can create. The idea is from the game Hot Wire.
