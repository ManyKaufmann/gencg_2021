### **HSLU, Digital Ideation, with Guillaume Massol** 

Each day we were introduced to a new topic. After the input and some own researches we were free to sketch, create and play around on our own.

The last week we were free to work further on a project from the other days or create new project.

For the projects we were working with p5.js.
